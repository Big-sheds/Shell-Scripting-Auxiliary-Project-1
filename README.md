# Shell-Scripting-Auxiliary-Project-1

### Shell Scripting

 **These tasks, is to learn how to take user input, perform basic math operations, work with directories and files, create loops, and interact with external websites. You will also learn how to create backups of files, generate random numbers, and convert temperature units. Moreover, by combining these tasks into a single script, you will learn how to structure your code effectively, use conditional statements and loops to control program flow, and write reusable functions.**



## **TASK :**

1. Ask the user for their name and age, and output a message with their name and the year they were born.
